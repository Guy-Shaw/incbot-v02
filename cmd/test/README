Tests
-----

test-esyms.c
  Ensure that errno.h is included whenever any of the symbolic names
  of Unix errno values are mentioned.

  But not in comments, not strings, and not in #include directives


test-var-err.c
test-fun-err.c
  Ensure that mention of @identifier{err} does not trigger the
  #include <err.h>, but a call of the function err() does.
